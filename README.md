Building a Large Language Model from scratch, written in Python in an ipynb file. Based on the supplementary code for the "Build a Large Language Model From Scratch" book by Sebastian Raschka. Repository at https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch
The random notes docx is for jotting down what I understand about this topic and questions I have about alternate methods to implement these models
